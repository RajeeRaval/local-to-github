    <p>This is just a demonstration to practice initializing a Git repository and publishing a local file to GitHub.<br> The process involves using basic Git commands like git init to set up a new repository, adding files with git add, committing changes with git commit, and finally pushing the repository to GitHub using git remote and git push.<br> It's part of a learning exercise to understand the workflow and fundamentals of Git and GitHub.</p>

    <p> This is a new feature</p>
